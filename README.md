# Belly-button-challenge


In this assignment, I will try to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) , which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


Code has been written using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js and a bar chart, bubble chart and a bonus gauge chart to show the dataset.
